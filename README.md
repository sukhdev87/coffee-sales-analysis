Coffee Shop Sales: A Quick Analysis
About This Project
This is a small exploratory data analysis (EDA) project to understand sales patterns at a coffee shop. The goal is to answer two main questions:

Which coffee products are the most (and least) popular, and how do these trends change with the seasons?
What are the most profitable times of day, and how do earnings differ between weekdays and weekends?
Key Insights from the Data
1. Product Sales by Season
The analysis shows that sales are dominated by just one or two key products.

Go-to Drink: Americano with Milk is by far the best-selling item, leading sales in Monsoon, Summer, and Winter.
Autumn Exception: In Autumn, the Latte becomes the most popular drink.
Low Sellers: Espresso and Hot Chocolate consistently show the lowest sales figures across all seasons.
2. Hourly Earnings: Weekday vs. Weekend
Timing has a major impact on the shop's average earnings.

Peak Profitability: The most profitable time for the shop is the evening rush, peaking at 7 PM (19:00) on weekdays and 8 PM (20:00) on weekends.
Morning Rush: Weekdays see a significant morning rush, with a sharp earnings spike at 7 AM.
Weekend Lull: In contrast, weekends experience a surprising dip in earnings at 8 AM, suggesting a much slower start to the day.
Afternoon: Both weekdays and weekends show a smaller, secondary earnings peak around the lunch/afternoon hours (1-5 PM).
Conclusion
This quick analysis reveals that the shop's revenue is heavily driven by Americano with Milk and shows that the busiest, most profitable hours are concentrated in the evenings (7-8 PM) and the weekday morning rush (7 AM).
